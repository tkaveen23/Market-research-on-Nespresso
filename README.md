# Market-research-on-Nespresso

Developed a market research proposal in response to a Nespresso client brief. The objective of the market research proposal is to help Nespresso meet their business goals and attain sustainable growth. Understanding coffee users' attitudes, brand perceptions, consumer appetites, and changing trends in the coffee industry are the main goals of the research. A questionnaire was created to get perspectives from coffee drinkers. A questionnaire is also included.
